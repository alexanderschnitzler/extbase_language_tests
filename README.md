# extbase_language_tests
Functional test suite for testing language settings in the context of Extbase.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexanderschnitzler/extbase_language_tests.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/alexanderschnitzler/extbase_language_tests)

## What does it do?

This testsuite is a growing amount of tests to ensure if and which parts of the TYPO3 localization settings work when using the Extbase persistence.

## Why is it necessary?

Because the current implementation of localization settings behave completely different from how the core behaves. An overview is necessary to know what exactly is wrong and how to fix it in the future.
